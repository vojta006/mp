In this paper we will discuss implementation of text adventure game. The game is inspired by space shuttle Columbia disaster, which occurred in 2003. The paper also focuses on software technologies description used for development. There are HTML and CSS for static webpage content and its design. Then there is a JavaScript handling user's requests and dynamically modifies the webpage. Theoretical section also covers another software technologies such as version control systems and \LaTeX and also introduces the concept of object-oriented programming. An alternative to JavaScript as the main programming language for the text adventure is mentioned in section TADS3. 

The text adventure, which takes place on board the fictional rocket Shumaker-Levi 9, has been developed. The game includes 4 rooms and is designed to be completed in less than an hour.
